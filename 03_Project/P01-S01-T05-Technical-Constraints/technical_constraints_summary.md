# Technical Constraints Summary: PommeDelice Website

## Date: 2024-06-18

## Agent: elicitation-agent (Simulated)

## Based On:
- Project.md (PommeDelice E-commerce Website)
- All previous outputs from P01-S01-T01 to P01-S01-T04

## Identified Technical Constraints & Considerations:

1.  **Target Platform:** Web application accessible via modern desktop and mobile browsers.
2.  **Hosting:** Cloud-based hosting required for scalability and reliability. (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure). Specific provider to be determined in Phase 3 (Technical Architecture).
3.  **Technology Stack (Preferences from Project.md, open to Technology Advisor input):**
    *   **Frontend:** Modern JavaScript framework (React, Vue, or Svelte mentioned as examples).
    *   **Backend:** Node.js, Python, or Ruby mentioned as examples. Decision pending further architectural review.
    *   **Database:** Relational (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) based on detailed data modeling in Phase 3.
4.  **Security:**
    *   HTTPS must be enforced for all traffic.
    *   Compliance with standard web security practices (OWASP Top 10 considerations).
    *   Secure handling of user credentials and personal data.
    *   Payment processing must be PCI DSS compliant (likely via integration with a compliant gateway like Stripe or PayPal).
5.  **Performance:**
    *   Key pages should load in under 2 seconds.
    *   System must handle an initial target of 100 concurrent users.
6.  **Integration:**
    *   Must integrate with a third-party payment gateway.
7.  **Maintainability & Scalability:**
    *   Codebase should follow good practices to be maintainable.
    *   Architecture should allow for future scaling of users and features.
8.  **Budget Considerations:** While not strictly a technical constraint, technology choices should be mindful of potential licensing costs, operational expenses, and development team skill sets. (Detailed budget to be part of overall project plan).
9.  **Data Privacy:** Adherence to relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR if applicable to target audience).

## Next Steps in Process:
Phase 1 (Initial User Input & Project Inception) is now complete.
The project should proceed to Phase 2 (Discovery & Strategy), starting with P02-S02-T01 (Problem Statement Refinement) or equivalent as defined in the master workflow.
