# 05_PRD_Generator Documentation

This folder contains all documentation artifacts for Phase 3, Step 5 (PRD Generator) of DafnckMachine v3.1. Each file supports a specific task in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) generation process, ensuring a comprehensive, actionable, and autonomous system specification.

## Structure
- **System_Overview_and_Vision_Definition.md**: Defines the core mission, vision, agentic architecture, and lifecycle automation for the system.
- *(Add additional files for each subsequent task, e.g., User_Interaction_Model.md, Technology_Stack_Matrix.md, etc.)*

## Usage
- Each file follows the DafnckMachine v3.1 PRD template, with actionable sections, example entries, and validation checklists.
- Update files as the system vision, requirements, or agent roles evolve.

## Best Practices
- Reference the main [PRD_Template.md](../PRD_Template.md) for structure and section guidance.
- Ensure all documentation is clear, actionable, and ready for autonomous agent consumption.
