**Example:**
- "All components are tested with Jest and React Testing Library. End-to-end tests are run with Cypress."

## 2. Testing Types
- Unit tests for components and utilities
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end (E2E) tests for user flows

**Example Table:**
| Test Type   | Tool                  | Example                        |
